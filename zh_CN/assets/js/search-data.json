You’ll have these options:  If no thumbnail has been uploaded, you can:          Upload Thumbnail        If a thumbnail already exists, you can:          Clear Thumbnail      Replace Thumbnail      View Image      Note that the thumbnail is saved immediately, even if you cancel out of the dialog.Change your account informationThe fields visible here are configurable by an Admin, but the common fields are the following:  First Name  Last Name  Email  Login  Home Page  Password (includes a double-confirm)Admins can choose what fields show up here by clicking on the gear menu in the top right corner of the dialog and selecting “Configure layout…”. Select “Apply” to save any layout changes.Change your email notification settingsShotgun can send email notifications to you based on written updates to Entities that have notes and replies (Notes, Tickets, Deliveries, Tasks, etc.). The personal settings here allow you to control when Shotgun sends email to you. Here are the current notification options:  Subscribe to Notes in your Inbox  Subscribe to Updates in your InboxThe rest of the options are legacy, as of Shotgun 5.0. You’ll only see options for notifications for the related Entities that an Admin has enabled for the site (so if you’re not using Tickets, you won’t see an option to subscribe to Tickets).See Site Preferences to learn more about customizing legacy email notifications or watch the video below.Please note: When Shotgun sends an email notification, it will BCC all people who should be getting the email and show “undisclosed recipients” instead of their email addresses. We do this because some studios want to show this information and some do not. If you’d like to display this information in the Note body, you can choose to display the “To”, “CC”, and “Tasks” fields in the email for Notes, which you can configure by going to Site Preferences &amp;gt; Email Layouts and User Defaults. Choose the email type to configure (Notes, Tickets, Deliveries, Tasks, Versions) and save your changes.Notifications and permissions: People will never receive notifications related to projects they’re not allowed to view, regardless of their personal notification settings. Disabled user accounts will also never receive email notifications.Change your following settingsYou can choose to follow items and people in Shotgun. The My Following Settings page will only show options for things you are already following. For example, at first you may only see options to follow Tasks.If you start to follow an Asset, you will see options for following Assets appear in your settings.",

    "content": "Inbox and followingThe Inbox allows you to see activity on all the things that are important to you and your work. Through the concept of following, you can receive notifications when new Notes, Versions, Publishes, or other important changes are made on things that are related to your work.  Whenever you receive a new message, it will automatically appear in the left pane and you’ll receive a notification.  Note: If you are using the latest release of Chrome or Safari, you can also receive a notification pop-up.Selecting the message will load its details in the right pane and mark the message as read.Using the InboxWhen looking at the top of the Inbox, you’ll see a handful of tools designed to be fast and allow you to digest the information you need to get your work done as quickly as possible. Hover on the image below to see explanations of the tools.    Pro tip: You can also mark multiple notes read or unread to help you get to Inbox Zero. Select the messages you would like to mark as read, right click, and select “Mark Read.”Replying to NotesWhen viewing a Note update, reply to the Note by clicking on the “Add a reply…” area at the bottom of the Note thread.What will appear in your InboxYou receive updates in your Inbox based on two things: what you’re following and your follow settings. To adjust your follow settings, click on the drop-down menu from your profile picture, in the upper right corner. Choose Account Settings and select “My Following Settings.” Once in your following settings, you can fine-tune the updates you receive. The left column provides options for when you receive updates on creation events (such as a new Note, Version, or Publish), while the right column is for selecting when an update is received whenever a field is updated (such as when a Status is changed on an Asset you’re following).  Note: If you are not following a particular entity type, the options for it will not appear in your settings page.FollowingIn order to see updates in your Inbox, you need to first follow the thing you’re interested in. To follow an update, click on the “Follow” button, located on the top right of any entity detail page. Once you’re following something, you’ll receive a notification in your Inbox whenever there is an update, such as a new Note, Version, or Publish.Options for following  If you’re looking for something specific to follow, you can search for it with the global search and click the “Follow” button from the list of results.  You can also follow an entity from a Detail, Thumbnail, or List view by right-clicking the entity and selecting “Follow Selected.”  Last, if you are assigned to a Task, you are automatically following that Task.Enable following on creation events and updatesAdmins can define which entity events, such as a new Version or a Publish, are followable on a site. You define which entities are followable by heading to the Site Preferences &amp;gt; Entities page and then selecting which creation events you’d like enabled on each entity.Once an entity is set up to create events, Admins can further refine what users can follow via the Global Follow Settings page under the Admin drop-down menu in the upper right.Similar to the Follow Settings a user can access via their Inbox, the Global Follow Settings page sets what those users see on their own Follow Settings page:![Global follow settings](https://sabsky.github.io/docs-test/images/02_global_follow_settings.png)Updating email notificationsYou can receive an email notification at the same time you receive an update in your Inbox. Access these settings via the “Email Notification Settings” from your Account Settings page.  Note: You can subscribe to Notes and Updates in your Inbox, but the rest of the options are legacy.Using the Inbox for reviewScreening Room is directly integrated into the Inbox. First, to receive updates about when a new Version is ready for review, follow the person who’s creating the Versions you want to know about. You can follow people from the People page by right-clicking and then selecting “Follow Selected.”Now, whenever that person creates a new Version, you’ll receive an update in your Inbox that displays a playable thumbnail you can launch in the Overlay Player. From the Overlay Player, use the note and annotation tools to comment on the work.![Overlay player](https://sabsky.github.io/docs-test/images/04_overlay_player.png)When you’re done commenting, hit the escape key or click outside of the Overlay Player to return to the Inbox.
